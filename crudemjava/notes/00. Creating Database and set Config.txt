00. Creating Database and set Config

01.
Starting with IDE, we create a Java Project and also a folder called "resources" or something like, and paste MySQL scripts and Connector.

02.
Inside the folder "src", create a package. Using the example: "com.contacts.model".

03.
And, inside the class, we set objects using as reference what I've done on SQL script.
Example:

SQL Script
	Table contatos;
	id int,
	nome varchar,
	idade int,
	dataCadastro date.

Java objects
	public class Agenda {
    	private int  id;
    	private String  nome;
    	private int idade;
    	private Date dataCadastro;
	}

The type of date on Java is java.util, that imports a package to help on creating a Date.

04.
After this, generate Getters and Setters. Follow this steps:
	- Source;
	- Getters and Setters (on Netbeans is "insert code...").

05.
Now, we'll do that Java and MySQL be connected with driver arqchive, through the java package. Steps:
	- Click on java project;
	- Properties;
	- Build path (On Netbeans is: Build > Compile > Manage Java Plataforms > Sources);
	- Add JAR File;
	- Search for MySQL connector on "resources" folder;
	- And add driver.

06.
There's a package administrators like MAVEN that helps to do this automatically, but that's how works on teamwork.

07.
Now, we'll mentionate where's the connection between Java and Database creating a "factory" of connections. Example:
	- Creating package: "com.contacts.factory";
	- Creating a class cakked "ConnectionFactory".

08.
And now, inside the class ConnectionFactory, this are the steps to config:
	- public static final String USERNAME = "root";
	(we are passing as final because mysql username doesn't change)
	- public static final String PASSWORD = "";
	- Select the path of database with SQL Door (3306)
		- the connection MUST be a JDBC;
		- and also, connect with the database name;
		- Example: public static final String DATABASE_URL = "jdbc:mysql//localhost:3306/agenda";

09.
And then, the connection with database, referencing mysql driver:
	- public static Connection (sql connection) createConnectionToMySQL {
		Class.forName ("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"); //Class is carrying by JVM.
	}
10.
To avoid full fill JVM space and overload MySQL server, inside of PSVM we set some configurations to reconnect user one time only and save connection, instead of connect every turn.
Example:
	- Connection con = creatConnectionToMySQL (); //Call method
	- if (con!=null){ // "if" avoid to connect several times
		System.out.println ("Connection with success!");
		con.close ();
	}
