01. Manipulating Objects with MySQL database

01.
Defining the structure of manipulate objects with sql, we use DAO (Decentralized autonomous organization) structure, that intermediate the path between Java Classes and MySQL, and apply our business rules.

02.
And starting, we creat a package properly for DAO and also a class, importing agenda model class:
	- com.contacts.dao
	- ContatoDAO
	- import com.contacts.model.Contact;

Also connection and prepare statement imports:

	import java.sql.PreparedStatement;
	import com.mysql.jdbc.Connection;


03.
Also, creat a method as a Instance of class "Contato", to do the insert.
	
	public void save (Contato contato){

	}

Inside the method, we do an Insert Into for SQL, passing parameters as "?", that converts into a data when are requesting connection with database:
	
	String sql = "insert into contatos (nome, idade, datacadastro) values (?, ?, ?)";

To call the Connection variable, we insert an Connection object as null. This will be used to help us to connect.

	Connection conn = null;
	
And then, we'll gonna use a class to execute the structure of connection between Java and SQL.

	PrepareStatement (com.sql) pstm = null;

Now, we'll set a TryCatch to verify if Sever is working, using our class ConnectionFactory.
	
	conn = (Connection) ConnectionFactory.createConnectionToMySQL();

Until inside TryCatch, we set a PrepareStatement class connected with our variable "conn", using a parse to String.
	
	pstm = (PreapareStatement) conn.prepareStatement(sql); // do a parse String using the data inside "sql" variable

To pass information between class and the prepareStatement, we do a parse for each data and their primitive type that are waiting by Query and use the function Get.
	
	pstm.setString (1, contato.getNome());
	pstm.setInt (2, contato.getIdade());
	pstm.setDate (3, new Date(contato.getDataCadastro().getTime())));

	Structure explained:
	preapreSatement variable + set instance of data type waiting by Query + position of the object + pass String (contato) + getObjectFromAntherClass

Closing and execute the statement:

	pstm.execute;

To finish, if something different happend, we do a Catch with an Exception:
	cacth (Exception e) {
		e.printStackTrace();
	}

So, if everything goes well, we do a "finally" to close all connections and flow of statements:
	finally {
	try{
	if (conn!=null){
	conn.close();
	}
	if (pstm!=null){
	pstm.close();
	}
	}
	}
If something strange happens:
	cacth (Exception e) {
		e.printStackTrace();
	}
